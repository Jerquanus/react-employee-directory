# react-employee-directory

## Description

I want the user to be able to view their employee directory at so that they would have quick access to non-sensitve information about their employees. The user "employer" would als be about to search for a specific employee by filtering through the directory using their name.

This places focus on me breaking the application's UI into components, managing component states, and responding to user events.

The Random User API runs so that whenever the pages loads - a table of employees should render. This should allow the user or "employer/manager" to search through their pool of employees. 

The user is also to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
